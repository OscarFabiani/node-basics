This file explores the basics of the Node Package Manager.


npm: The Node Package Manager is a command line tool used by developers to share and control modules (or packages) of JavaScript
code written for use with Node.js.


package.json: When starting a new project using the npm init command, npm generates a package.json file. This file lists the
package dependancies for your project. Since npm packages are regularly updated, the package.json file allows you to set
specific version numbers for each dependancy. This ensures that updates to a package don't break your project. This file
alos acts as manifest for the project containing basic project info as well as scripts.

package.json format:
{
  "name": "project-name", //This is the name of the project
  "version": "0.0.1", //This is the version of the project
  "description": "A project", //This describes the project
  "main": "server.js", //This is the "entry point" to the project
  "scripts": { //This object contains scripts that can be run
    "start": "node server.js" //standard script used to start application by convention
  },
  "dependencies": { //This is an object with packages which the project is dependant on and their version
    "package-name": "version"
  },
  "repository": { //This object contains repository details
    "url": "https://glitch.com/edit/#!/hello-express"
  },
  "license": "MIT", //This specifies the project's license
  "keywords": [ //This is a list of keywords related to the project
    "node",
    "glitch",
    "express"
  ]
}

node modules folder: npm saves packages in a folder called node modules. These packages can be installed either globally in a
root node modules folder, accessible by all projects, or locally within a project's own node-modules folder, accessible only to
that project. Most developers prefer to install packages local to each project to create a seperation between the dependencies
of different projects.


SemVer: Semantic versioning is an industry standard for software versioning aiming to make it easier to manage dependencies
by communicating what kind of changes that projects who depend on the package can expect if they update.
EX:
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

This means that PATCHes are bug fixes and MINORs add new features but neither of them break what worked before, while MAJORs
add changes that won't work with earlier versions.


Tilde prefix for version: Prefixing a dependencies version with a tilde allows a npm dependency to get updated to the latest
PATCH version.

Caret prefix for version: Prefixing a dependencies version with a caret allows a npm dependency to get updated to the latest
MINOR and PATCH version.


SHORTCUTS:

npm || npm help: Opens help
npm init||create: creeates a package.json file
npm install||i||add: installs all modules listed as dependencies in package.json
npm install <package>: installs a package in the local node_modules folder
npm uninstall||unlink||un||remove||rm||r <package>: deletes a package from the local node_modules folder
npm list||la||ll: lists installed packages
npm root: lists the path of the node_modules folder


Global vs Local installations:

After some research, I have found that it is a good idea to install most packages locally. The main reason for this looks to
be that if I install a package globally that a project requires, this will inevitably conflict with another project which
requires a different version of said package. Furthermore, this issue is extended to anyone who downloads my package. These
concerns mostly regard packages who use CLI commands and are useful in a general cross-project sense. Still, with the advent
of npx, the benefits of glabally installing even these (most notably the ability to easily call CLI commands) has seemingly
been almost reduced to zero. 

NPX: npx is a cli tool that is included with npm as of version 5.2. It allows the execution on package commands without the
need to have said package installed. The package will be search for in the local node_modules folder, then the global
node_modules folder. If it is not found, the package will be temporarily installed for execution before it is deleted.
This is particularly useful for large packages that are run infrequently such as create-react-app as well as running
local packages without referencing node_modules/.bin as one typically would when running local packages.
