This file explores the basics of Node and Express.

Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript tool that allows developers to write backend (server-side) programs in
JavaScript. Node.js comes with built-in modules (small, independent programs) that help facilitate this
purpose.
Some of the core built-in modules are:

http: a module that acts as a server.

fs (File System): a module that reads and modifies files.

path: a module for working with directory and file paths.

assert (Assertion Testing): a module that checks code against prescribed constraints.


Node.js Global Objects: objects that are available in all modules.

__dirname: The direstory name of the current module.


Express: Express is a popular module/library/framework that runs between the server created by Node.js and the
frontend pages of a web application. Express also handles an application's routing. Routing directs users to the
correct page based on their interaction with the application.


Express methods: Some common Express methods are listen(), get(), and post().


App object: The app object conventionally denotes the Express application

Creating an Express app object: After requiring or importing express, an Express app object can be created
by setting a variable to an instance of express().
EX:
const express = require('express');
const app = express();


App Methods:

Listen method: The listen() method tells your server to listen on a given port, putting it in a running state.
NOTE: This method is identical to Node's http.Server.listen().
Syntax: app.listen([port[, host[, backlog]]][, callback])
EX:
//This tells the server to listen to port 3000 and includes a callback function that logs a message to the console.
app.listen(3000, () => {console.log('app is listening on port 3000')});


Routing Methods: Routing methods route http requests There are many, but the most common are get and post.
Syntax: app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER) or app.METHOD(path, callback [, callback ...])
METHOD is an http method in lowercase, PATH is a relative path on the server, and HANDLER is a route handler
function that Express calls when the route is matched.

Get Method: Routes HTTP GET requests to the specified path with the specified callback functions.
Syntax: app.get(PATH, HANDLER) or app.get(path, callback)


Route handlers: Route handler functions are called when a route method's PATH is matched and take a request
object and response object as parameters.
Syntax: function (req, res) {...}


Response Object (res): The res object represents the HTTP response that an Express app sends when it gets an
HTTP request.

Response Object Methods:

res.send: Sends the HTTP response.
Syntax: res.send(body);

res.sendFile: Transfers the file at the given path. The path argument must be an absolute path to the file.
Syntax: res.sendFile(path [, options] [, fn])


Serving a response string to GET requests matching the root "/" path:
EX:
//This serves a string response when an HTTP request is made on the root path.
app.get("/",(req, res) => {res.send("Hello Express")});

Serving a response HTML file to GET requests matching the root "/" path.
EX:
//This serves an HTML file at the specifies path when an HTTP request is made on the root path.
NOTE: This assumes there is an index.html file at the root path of the project.
app.get("/",(req, res) => {res.sendFile(__dirname + "/index.html")});
